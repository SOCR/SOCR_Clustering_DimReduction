Overview
========

The [SOCR 2D and 3D Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction RShiny App](https://socr.shinyapps.io/SOCR_Clustering/) provides an interactive web-based user interface to display multi-variate and high-dimensional data in 2D and 3D. 

R Code
======

The examples, demonstrations and simulations are designed, built, implemented and validated in the [R environment](https://www.r-project.org). 

The source R code for the package is in the [**code**](https://github.com/SOCR/SOCR_Clustering_DimReduction/tree/master/code) folder.


Team
====

[SOCR Team](https://www.socr.umich.edu/people/) including **Shihang Li**, Yongxiang Zhao, Simeone Marino, and [Ivo D. Dinov](https://umich.edu/~dinov), and others.
